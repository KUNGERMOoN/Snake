# Snake++
A simple Snake game written in Visual C++

# Usage
*(Note: the program is currently Windows-only)*

Go to [relases](https://github.com/KUNGERMOoN/Snake/releases) and download the exe for appropriate architecture.
The program is self-contained and has no external dependencies (aside from some Windows insides).
You can run the program without Admin privileges, but it needs to be placed in a directory with write permissions (such as Documents)
