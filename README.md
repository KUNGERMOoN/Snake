![snake](https://github.com/KUNGERMOoN/Snake/blob/main/Img/snake.gif?raw=true)

## Features
- Multiple colors (red and green)
- Saving best score
- Animations on title screen and game over screen
- Easy to install

## Usage

_(Note: the program is currently Windows-only)_

Go to [relases](https://github.com/KUNGERMOoN/Snake/releases) and download an exe for appropriate architecture.
The program is mostly self-contained and only depends on some libs shipped with Windows.
You can run it without Admin privileges, but it needs to be placed in a directory with write permission (such as Documents)

A file with the best score (Data.txt) will be created in the same directory as the exe
